# sprint5project

This project is taking US car advertisement data and looking at aspects of the amount of the time the cars stay listed along with their price and make.

The tool demonstrates a histogram looking at the days listed and a scatter plot looking at days listed vs price with a toggle highlighting car types or car makes.
